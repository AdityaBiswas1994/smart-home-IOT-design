# smart_home_IOT_design
While the cost of living is going up, there is a growing focus to involve technology to lower those prices.  With this in mind the Smart Home project allows the user to build and maintain a house that is smart enough to keep energy levels down while providing more automated applications. 
Our project on Smart Home System has some similar operations which can be implemented in many other fields. In Smart Hotel System the RFID can be used as unique room number which can be used to enter the room and the PIR and DHT11 sensor is used to control the temperature of the room. Also an override option can be given to the guest living in a particular room using Bluetooth module. Similarly, this system can be used in seminar rooms of the college allocated only for the teachers for any meeting and also can be used in any IT sector office for any team allocated to a particular project. They can use the room for project meeting purposes and also for group discussions.
